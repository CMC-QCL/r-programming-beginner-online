#### QCL Literacy: L1-Coding

Instructor: Dr. Jeho Park, Director of the Quantitative and Computing Lab at Claremont McKenna College

## Summary
R is an open source statistical programming language. R is widely used in industry as well as in academia for statistical analysis and data visualization. In this workshop, we introduce the basics of R language and its programming environment through simple hands-on examples.

### Target Audience 
This workshop is designed for beginners in R programming, so no prior knowledge of R programming is needed. However, general programming knowledge in any programming languages will help understand the programming concepts (that's why it's Level 2).
